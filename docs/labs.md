# Practice Labs

The Practice Labs are notebooks you can execute to understand what the CWL CommandLineTools and Workflows do in the context of this module.

There are four sets of notebooks, each set with one or more notebooks:

1 - **CWL CommandLineTools**: this first set of notebooks targets the Producer Application Package individual CommandLineTools. By running these notebooks, you'll generate the intermediary outputs of the Producer Application Package

The notebooks included are:
- 1. Discovery
- 2. Convert-search
- 3. Water bodies detection
- 4. STAC Catalog
- 5. STAC Zarr


2 - **Producer CWL Workflow**: run the producer CWL Workflow that chains the CommandLineTools and sub-workflow:

- 1. Producer

3 - **Exploitation**: read the results generated by the **Producer CWL Workflow**:

- 1. Exploitation

4 - **Consumer CWL Workflow**: run the consumer CWL Workflow that reads the outputs generated by the **Producer CWL Workflow**:

- 1. Consumer
